      <h2>Understanding Consent and Boundaries</h2>
      <p>Consent means giving permission for something to happen or agreeing to do something. Respecting boundaries is about understanding and honoring personal limits‚Äîboth yours and others'.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Principles of Consent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freely given:</strong> Given without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of substances</li>
        <li><strong>Reversible:</strong> Can be withdrawn at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Informed:</strong> All parties understand what is being agreed to</li>
        <li><strong>Enthusiastic:</strong> Should be given with positive feelings, not reluctance</li>
        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Saying yes to one thing doesn't mean saying yes to everything</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Setting Healthy Boundaries</h3>
      <p>You have the right to set boundaries about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your personal space</li>
        <li>Your time and energy</li>
        <li>Your body and physical contact</li>
        <li>Your emotions and thoughts</li>
        <li>Your digital presence and privacy</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Communicating Boundaries</h3>
      <p>Clear communication helps establish healthy boundaries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use "I" statements: "I feel uncomfortable when..."</li>
        <li>Be direct and clear about your limits</li>
        <li>Listen respectfully when others express their boundaries</li>
        <li>Remember that "no" is a complete sentence</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In Uganda, cultural values emphasize respect in relationships. Understanding consent and boundaries is consistent with showing respect for yourself and others.</p>
